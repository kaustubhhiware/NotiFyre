# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be a waste of your time as well as ours if you have not contacted us before hand when working on some feature / issue. You can contact me on the Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/552015885141292/ or on relevant issues itself.

I welcome any contribution that could enhance app's functionality. Kindly follow the simple steps below to submit a Pull Request.
